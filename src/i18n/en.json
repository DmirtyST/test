      "textFirst": "Current payment platforms, event the biggest ones are localised. WeChat Pay [1] is clustered in China, Momo [2] in Vietnam and PayLah! [3] in Singapore are examples. There is no one system of payment platforms that have deep world-wide penetration.",
      "textTwo": "Human mobility is global. We will most likely travel to a place where our primary mode of mobile payments are not widely adopted. Even if we want to sign on to the local platform, it may not be possible to do so due to local jurisdiction and financial rules.",
      "textThree": "For example, an European with a Monzo [4] account travels to Vietnam and goes for a meal with his local friends. He finds out that it is impossible to split the bill with his friends because all of them are using the local Momo payment gateway. Monzo accounts are only available to Europe while Momo is localised to Vietnam. None of them can get onto each other platform. In the end, cash was used to split the bills.",
      "textFour": "Even if itâ€™s possible for the above person to join Momo (or vice versa), he will have to manage another wallet. Multiply this scenario a few times, he will end up having multiple accounts with disparate pots of monies.",
      "textLast": "The iValut Platform provides for the cross integration of payment gateways so that each user can send monies to another person easily, regardless of their respective payment systems."

These components are very often well tested not just in terms of codes but also in terms of usability in the field. They are well supported both officially and by developers familiarity at large.",
      "textEven": "In the development of the iValut Platform, we aim to avoid the not-created-here mentality. We strive to maintain technical agility by daving all components being replaceable.",
      "textLast": "Through adopting these software components, we miminise our resources in solving common software requirements. This will allow us to stay focused to our value proposition of enabling the cross integration of payment platforms."

      "title": "Tech Stack",
